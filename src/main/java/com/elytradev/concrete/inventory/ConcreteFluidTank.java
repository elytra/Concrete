/**
 * A base class for managing fluid storage.
 *
 * <h2>Validation</h2>
 *
 * Just like {@link ConcreteItemStorage}, ConcreteFluidTank <em>does not</em> perform its own validation. Rather, this
 * is offloaded to its own wrapper for such functionality, {@link ValidatedFluidTankWrapper}.
 *
 * <h2>Serialization and Deserialization</h2>
 *
 * <p>If you're using this object to manage the fluid tank of a TileEntity, it takes three small tweaks to get no-fuss
 * serialization. In your constructor, add
 *
 * <code><pre>fluidTank.listen(this::markDirty);</pre></code>
 *
 * <p>This will mark your tile dirty any time the inventory changes, so that Minecraft won't skip serialization. Then in
 * writeToNBT:
 *
 * <code><pre>tagOut.setTag("fluid_tank", CapabilityFluidHandler.FLUID_HANDLER_CAPABILITY.writeNBT(fluidTank, null));</pre></code>
 *
 * <p>and in readFromNBT:
 *
 * <code><pre>CapabilityFluidHandler.FLUID_HANDLER_CAPABILITY.readNBT(fluidTank, null, tag.getTag("fluid_tank"));</pre></code>
 *
 * <p>Where <code>fluidTank</code> is your ConcreteFluidTank object. At that point the Forge Capability system will
 * do all the work for you on this, and you can focus on the interesting part of making your tile do what it's supposed to.
 *
 * <h2>Exposing as a capability</h2>
 *
 * <p>This was mentioned above in the Validation section, but although this object supplies the IFluidHandler interface,
 * generally you want to create a ValidatedFluidTankWrapper instead. These wrappers are okay to cache or memoize,
 * and merely provide a succinct delegation based on the access rules this object provides.
 *
 * <p>Simplifying hasCapability and getCapability are outside the scope of this object... but remember that "null" is a
 * valid side, and often represents the side a probe observer accesses, so plan your views accordingly.
